Intuition - 

Assign K cetroids int the data set
change the position of centroids according to the data in the dataset
contiune this until the position of centrids does not change

number of centroids can be decided by the elbow method
the number at which elbow occurs in the graph between WCSS(within clusters sum of squares) and number of clusters will be the number of centroids.

random selection of centroids could cause problem.
