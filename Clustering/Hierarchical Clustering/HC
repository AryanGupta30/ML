Agglomerative HC

Intuition - 
make each data point as a cluster - N clusters
take 2 closest data points and make them a cluster - N-1 clusters
take 2 closest clusters and make them one cluster - N-2 clusters
repeat previous step until there is only 1 cluster


distance between 2 clusters
closest points
furthest points
average distance 
distance between centroids


create dendograms (graph between cluster data points and euclidean distance between them) for the data points
apply a threshold for distance between clusters which will allow us to know about the number of clusters the dataset is divided into.(number of vertical lines the threshold crosses).
