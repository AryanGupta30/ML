Intuition-
There is linear relationship between 1 dependent and more than 1 independent variable.
Add dummy column if there is categorical data instead of numerical data ( remove 1 to prevent dummy variable trap). 

Note - LinearRegression class takes care of dummy variable trap and best features(high P value or high statistical significance).

Steps-
1. Import the  Libraries

2. Import the datasets

3.Encoding Categorical Data

4.Split the dataset into test and train sets

5.Training Simple regression model on training set

6.Predicting the test set results
