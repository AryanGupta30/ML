version of ensemble learning(when you take multiple algorithms or same algorithm multiple times and put them together that results in much more powerful version)
Intuition - 

1.pick k data points from training set.
2.build decision trees associated with those training set.
3.choose the number of trees you want to build (repeat steps 1&2).
4.predict the value of new data point by averaging values of all the predicted values of all trees.
