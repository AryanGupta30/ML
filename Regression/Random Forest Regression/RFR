Version of ensemble learning(when you take multiple algorithms or same algorithm multiple times and put them together that results in much more powerful version).
Intuition - 

1.Pick k data points from training set.

2.Build decision trees associated with those training set.

3.Choose the number of trees you want to build (repeat steps 1&2).

4.Predict the value of new data point by averaging values of all the predicted values of all trees.
